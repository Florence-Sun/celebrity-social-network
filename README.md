#Celebrity Social Network Analysis
This project is to analyze the social network of celebrities by web scraping the photo captions from newyorksocialdiary web site.
The assumption is based on the fact that when people appear in the same photo, they are considered to know each other. 
By analyzing more than 100,000 photos, the most popular celebrity is Jean Shafiroff.
